GZDoomBuilder, Meridian 59 room editor port.
--------------
  
This is a port of the Doom map editor GZDoomBuilder from https://sourceforge.net/p/doombuilder/code/HEAD/tree/.

The master branch of this repo is a mirror of the GZDoomBuilder branch from the svn repo.
The develop branch is the up-to-date version of the Meridian 59 port.

The editor can edit Meridian 59 rooms in 2D and 3D format. Most GZDoomBuilder
special features work (e.g. stair building, some 3D room manipulations such as
texture dragging). The old Meridian 59 roomeditor is included as a node compiler,
and is called when saving a room.

To use this editor, fork the repo and open builder.sln. Build the projects and
run /Build/Builder.exe. To easily load Meridian 59 graphics (as bgf files), put
all the grd*.bgf files in a separate directory and add it using the editor's
Tools->Game Configuration menu. Make sure both the checkboxes for loading resources
as flats and textures are checked as shown in the following image:

The GZDoomBuilder port should still be able to create/modify Doom and Doom-related
maps, but porting maps from Doom to Meridian 59 format has not been attempted yet.

The .roo files generated by the editor work on [server 105](https://www.meridiannext.com)
and [server 112](http://meridian59.de) versions of Meridian 59.
